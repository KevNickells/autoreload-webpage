# What

A website skeleton to test wee things without carrying around a whole project's
stuff.

# Why

Sometimes a server is down or I don't want to code around a login or something.

# But TDD?

Not always useful for CSS stuff but I take your point. No need to use this if
you have a better workflow than me, friend.

# How

- `npm install reload -g` - installs reload on your system
- `reload -bs temp.html` - opens system browser (-b) and specifies the file to open(-s)
- File will reload on update
